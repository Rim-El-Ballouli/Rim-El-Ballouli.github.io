a model-based and architectural-based approach to prescribe systems</li>
<p>&lt;li&gt; Dfiened formally the semantics of the modeling language in the form of state
transition system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Demonstrated the proposed modeling with four case studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Developed an interpreter that comprehends system models expressed in Dr-BIP
