I" <h3> How are self-adaptive systems engineered?</h3>

<p>This post is my best effort of categorizing existing approaches withen the field of self adaptive systems</p>

<p>Extensive efforts have been put by 
engineers and researchers from different 
disciplines  to realize self-adaptive systems. This post 
discuses various approaches that have been developed over time. Each 
approach is inspired by a specific discipline and as such highlights 
complementary aspects of realizing self-adaptive 
systems. Figure below lists the different 2
disciplines and the several approaches branching from each discipline. For 
instance, 
developing a self-adaptive system from a control 
engineering perspective implies designing a control-based self-adaptive 
system whose behavior can 
change according to a set of well-formed mathematical models that 
can be formally analyzed.</p>
